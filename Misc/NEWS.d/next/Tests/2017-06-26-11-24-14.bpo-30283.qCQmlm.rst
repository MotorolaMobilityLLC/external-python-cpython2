regrtest: Enhance regrtest and backport features from the master branch.

Add options: --coverage, --testdir, --list-tests (list test files, don't run
them), --list-cases (list test identifiers, don't run them, :issue:`30523`),
--matchfile (load a list of test filters from a text file, :issue:`30540`),
--slowest (alias to --slow).

Enhance output: add timestamp, test result, currently running tests, "Tests
result: xxx" summary with total duration, etc.

Fix reference leak hunting in regrtest, --huntrleaks: regrtest now warms up
caches, create explicitly all internal singletons which are created on demand
to prevent false positives when checking for reference leaks.
(:issue:`30675`).
